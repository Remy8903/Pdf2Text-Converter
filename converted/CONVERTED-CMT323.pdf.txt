1.0 Business Scenario Analysis
Eco Grocer is a health-oriented organic store based in Malaysia. Eco Grocer specializes in
offering high-quality, organic, and healthy food products to its customers. With both an online
presence through platforms like Shopee and Lazada and a physical store in D'Alamanda Pudu
Impian, the company aims to make healthy living accessible and convenient.
1.1 Current Business Operations
Inventory Management
EcoGrocer utilizes the ERP System - SAP to track stock and inventory levels efficiently.
Inventory movements, lead times, and buffer stocks are monitored using a Just-In-Time (JIT)
ordering method. Monthly and weekly sales analysis trackers are employed to ensure orders are
placed promptly, reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts. Purchase Orders (POs) are
issued to vendors based on the ordering cycle, with ad hoc orders made for out-of-stock items.
Customer Relationships
Eco Grocer currently manages customer interactions using basic digital tools such as Facebook
Messenger, Business WhatsApp, and email. The company maintains an active social media
presence to promote products and respond to inquiries. Additionally, the company sends
promotional newsletters via email to inform customers about new products, discounts, and
events. Eco Grocer prioritises customer feedback to improve its offerings and services
continually. Rather than relying solely on traditional methods like suggestion boxes or email,
customers are invited to participate in quick surveys after their purchases through digital receipts
with embedded survey links or QR codes displayed at checkout counters.
Order & Supply Chain
Eco Grocer employs a semi-automated approach to managing its supply chain. The company
maintains a spreadsheet-based system to track inventory levels, sales patterns, and supplier lead
times. Orders are placed manually, based on the discretion of store managers, who analyse sales
trends and historical data. While this approach allows some flexibility, it relies heavily on human
oversight and can result in delays or inaccuracies during peak demand periods.
1
Internal Collaboration
Internal communication at Eco Grocer is segmented between management levels. The top
management team utilizes advanced collaborative platforms such as Microsoft Teams for
strategic discussions, project management, and document sharing. However, operational and
frontline staff primarily rely on traditional tools like WhatsApp for daily coordination and task
updates. While WhatsApp is accessible and easy to use, its lack of integration with other systems
and limited functionalities for task tracking or collaboration can lead to inefficiencies.
1.2 Challenges
1.2.1 Ineffective Inventory Management
EcoGrocer’s reliance on a spreadsheet-based inventory tracking system poses several challenges.
The manual nature of the process increases the likelihood of errors in inventory counts and
delays in updating stock levels. During peak shopping seasons or promotional events, the system
struggles to keep up with real-time inventory changes, leading to stockouts of high-demand items
or overstocking of slow-moving goods. Furthermore, the inability to integrate real-time sales
data with inventory tracking hampers the company's ability to forecast demand accurately and
optimize stock levels, especially for perishable products.
1.2.2 Cybersecurity Risks and Data Protection
EcoGrocer’s reliance on online platforms for sales and customer engagement exposes the
business to potential cybersecurity threats. The company faces the challenge of ensuring
customer data security, especially considering sensitive information such as personal details and
payment data. Without comprehensive security measures in place, EcoGrocer risks data breaches
that could harm its reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to financial losses, especially in the
growing e-commerce space.
1.2.3 Communication and Coordination Gaps
The divide between top management using advanced platforms like Microsoft Teams and
operational staff relying on WhatsApp creates gaps in collaboration and information flow.
Operational staff may miss important updates or fail to align with organizational goals due to the
2
informal nature of their communication tools. This inconsistency hampers cross-departmental
coordination, particularly during promotions, restocking campaigns, or issue resolution, reducing
overall efficiency.
1.3 Opportunities
1.3.1 Implementing Advanced Inventory Management Systems
Eco Grocer can adopt a robust inventory management system integrated with real-time tracking
and demand forecasting. Systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software or
specialised inventory platforms can provide automated low-stock alerts, real-time stock updates,
and waste tracking for perishables. This shift would improve stock optimisation, reduce waste,
and ensure product availability, even during peak demand periods.
1.3.2 Adopting an Integrated Supply Chain Management Platform
Introducing a Supply Chain Management (SCM) system would enable Eco Grocer to automate
supplier orders and track deliveries in real-time. This system could include vendor performance
analytics, automated restocking schedules, and demand-driven replenishment. By integrating this
with the inventory management system, Eco Grocer could improve supply chain transparency,
minimise delays, and better manage seasonal demand fluctuations.
1.3.3 Centralizing Customer Feedback and Introducing a Loyalty Program
Eco Grocer could implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to
consolidate feedback from all channels into a single platform. This system would enable detailed
trend analysis and faster response times to customer concerns. Additionally, launching a loyalty
program with personalized offers based on purchase history and preferences could foster
customer retention and encourage repeat purchases, strengthening long-term relationships.
3
2.0 Types of Information Systems and Their Role
2.1 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a suite of integrated software modules. ERP collects data
from many departments of firms and key business processes for internal business activities. ERP
systems optimise operations, reduce errors and improve efficiency by centralizing data and
automating tasks. For example, ERP can integrate the company operations like purchasing, sales,
inventory management and finance. It’s able to generate purchase orders automatically, track real
time inventory, manage sales orders and generate financial reports accurately. This integration
enhances decision making, decreases traditional effort and improves visibility. Finally, ERP
helps businesses to operate efficiently, reduce costs and achieve sustainable development.
2.2 Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a software solution that may capture and integrate
customer data from all over the organization. It helps businesses to consolidate and analyze
customer data and then share it to various systems and customer touch points across enterprises
through phone, email and customer service desk. Every single enterprise view of customers helps
businesses improve sales and services. For Eco Grocer, CRM helps to centralize customer
information, improve customer service, integrate loyalty programs, enhance customer
segmentation and monitor customer interaction. Eco Grocer can build a strong customer
relationship, customize offerings more precisely to their preferences and retain profitable
customers by implementing CRM for their business.

2.3 Supply Chain Management (SCM)
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a network of organizations and processes for procuring
materials, transforming them into products and distributing the product. SCM links suppliers,
manufacturing plants, distribution centres, retail outlets and customers to the business. In other
words, SCM is a powerful tool that can optimize inventory management, improve supplier
relationships and reduce supply chain disruptions. SCM provides real-time updates on supply
chain operations by integrating functions like procurement, logistics and inventory management.
Business owners are able to forecast demand for the product accurately, optimize inventory
levels and reduce overproducing and underproducing. Other than that, SCM provides
communication and collaboration with suppliers effectively. It enables the streamlining of the
order process, sharing demand forecasts and providing transparency in the production schedule
at the same time improving supplier relationships. In addition, SCM enables problem solving
capability in real-time by identifying potential issues earlier and finding solutions to overcome
the issue in advance. SCM provides actionable insight to prevent any disruption by tracking
external factors like market trends, geopolitical events and natural disasters.
2.4 E-Collaboration
Microsoft Teams and Slack are examples of E-Collaboration that have improved the way
businesses communicate and collaborate. Team members are able to share information, discuss
ideas and work together even at different physical locations by using these centralized hub
platforms. These tools can improve internal communication and collaboration significantly
because it facilitates real time communication, document sharing and project management.
Teams are able to access the latest data and insights quickly since these tools enable rapid
information sharing. So, the business is able to facilitate timely decision making, reduce response
time and improve overall operational efficiency. Furthermore, these tools help in a teamwork
environment like idea sharing, solutions finding and handling tasks together to achieve business
goals. In summary, E-Collaboration leads to innovative solutions and improves business
outcomes.

3.0 Supporting Operational and Strategic Activities
3.1 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Technology
The implementation of the SAP ERP system is important to ensure Eco Grocer’s operational
efficiency and strategic growth. For example, it operationalises inventory tracking, procurement,
and order management, thus reducing any possible errors from manual processes. Just-in-time
ordering helps keep inventory levels at an optimal stock, very important for perishable goods to
prevent waste. Sales analysis allows aligning inventory with customer demand to lower
operational costs.
Strategically, the system supports data-driven decision-making. By analysing the trend of
inventory, sales, and supplier performance, management gains insights to forecast demand,
optimize stock levels, and negotiate with vendors. The ERP provides a holistic view of the
business that helps Eco Grocer adapt to changes in the market and consumer behaviour. Its
scalability positions the company for future growth, whether through new product lines, market
expansion, or adopting new technologies. Overall, the ERP system is critically vital for Eco
Grocer's continued survival in the competitive health and organic food market.
3.2 Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
CRM consolidates customer information from social media, email, and in-store feedback into
one platform to ease customer service and allow for quicker responses to inquiries. It automates
tasks such as sending promotional newsletters and post-purchase surveys, freeing up staff for
more productive activities. CRM also helps Eco Grocer analyze purchase histories and
preferences for personalized marketing that will help improve customer engagement and
satisfaction.
It enables strategic data-driven decisions for customer loyalty and growth by revealing insight
into product popularity and market opportunities. It also facilitates loyalty programs, helps track
feedback in real-time, and thus assists Eco Grocer in finding the gaps in its services to work
toward improvement in healthy food offerings. Overall, CRM is vital for continued growth and
competitive advantage for Eco Grocer.

3.3 Supply Chain Management (SCM)
Integration of the Supply Chain Management system at Eco Grocer also enhances its operational
efficiency and strategic decision-making. It automates order processing, stock reordering, and
delivery tracking, hence reducing errors and improving fulfilment. In addition, real-time tracking
enables better transparency and vendor performance analysis ensures reliable suppliers, which
helps reduce costs and ensure product availability.
From a strategic standpoint, SCM allows for correct demand forecasting. This helps in inventory
management to avoid bottlenecks and waste. Additionally, the integration of ERP and CRM
systems allows for better operational coordination. The overall system of SCM would, therefore,
support growth by increasing flexibility, mitigating risks, and opening the door to new markets
for Eco Grocer.
3.4 E-Collaboration
E-collaboration tools are highly instrumental in both operational and strategic functions at Eco
Grocer, making the environment of the organization much more cohesive and effective.
Operationally, these tools, such as Microsoft Teams, enhance day-to-day communication and
task management, reducing dependence on slower modes of communication, including email.
This single workspace increases transparency in task assignments, thereby helping management
and staff stay coordinated to minimise miscommunication and delays in operations related to
restocking and customer service.
Strategically, e-collaboration tools ease better decision-making and innovations since
departments share knowledge effectively. This may be assisted by integrated management of
data-driven discussions for long-term planning with the help of real-time analytics on integrated
dashboards. E-collaboration encourages a more inclusive approach by taking input from all ranks
regarding formulating strategy.
7
Additionally, e-collaboration tools smooth onboarding and training as Eco Grocer scales. They
can ensure the business remains agile in the instance of market changes or disruptions along
supply chains through rapid communication. Finally, they enhance productivity to support the
company in its continuing ability to stay competitive within the health and organic food market.
